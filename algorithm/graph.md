- undirected graphs
	- set of vertices connected pairwise by edges
	- why
		- many applications
		- many algorithm
		- broadly useful
		- like internet properties with computers and communication device
		- precisely communication pattern
		- huge and flexible and dynamic
		- give some insight about the graph
	- terminology
		- Path: Sequence of vertices connected by edges
		- cycle: Path whose first and last vertices are the same
		- Two vertices are connected if there is a path between them
	- Some problem
		- Path: Is there a path between s and t
		- Shortest ath what is the shortest path between s and t
		- Cycle is there a cycle in the graph
		- Euler tour Is there a cycle that uses ech edge exactly onece
		- Hamilton tour Is there a cycle
		- which of these problem is difficult and 
	- representation
		- use integers between 0 and V-1
	- set of edges graph representation
		- maintain a list that represent the link
	- Adjacency-matrix graph representation
		- maintain a two-dimensional V-by-V boolean array
		- not widely used too big
	- Adjacency-list graph representation
