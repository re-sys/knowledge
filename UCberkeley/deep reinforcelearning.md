## lecture1:introduction and task overview
- we will learn 
	1. From supervised to decision making 
	2. Model-free algorithm: Q-learning policy gradient actor-critic
	3. Model-based algorithm: planning, sequence model
	4. Exploration
	5. Offline reinforcement learning
	6. Inverse reinforcement learning
- what is reinforcement learning
	- approach for learning decision from experience
- different from other learning
	- supervised: i.i.d data
	- reinforcement learning: not i.i.d previous output influence future input
		- ground truth answer not known, only know if we succeeded or failed
