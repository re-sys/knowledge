- rigid body definition
	- after Euclidean transformation that preserves distance between pairs of points
	- isometries $Aa+t$ where A is rotation
		- every column has length of one
		- very column is perpendicular with other
		- determinant = +1
	- homogeneous transformation with the homogeneous vector can make the Euclidean transformation become linear
