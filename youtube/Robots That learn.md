- rigid body definition
	- after Euclidean transformation that preserves distance between pairs of points
	- isometries $Aa+t$ where A is rotation
		- every column has length of one
		- very column is perpendicular with other
		- determinant = +1
	- homogeneous transformation with the homogeneous vector can make the Euclidean transformation become linear
	- se3 is a infinite small version of T
	- screw motion can represent the Euclidean transformation
		- so we can use the small angular velocity and translate velocity to compute the stuff
- data set
