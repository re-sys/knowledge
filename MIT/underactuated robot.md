- Lecture1 : Robot dynamics and model-based control
	- different robot control strategy
		- Altas: MPC + optimization
		- Quadruped robotï¼š RL
		- manipulation: imitation
	- what makes control difficult
		- Uncertainty/partial observation: observation
		- Actions have long-term consequence: controllability
		- nonlinear, high dimension
	- system representation
		- $\ddot{q}=f_{1}(q,\dot{q})+f_{2}(q,\dot{q})u$
			- "control affine" nonlinear system
		- Def (1) is fully actuated in $q,\dot{q}$ iff $f_{2}(q,\dot{q})$ is full row rank
