- Lecture1 : Robot dynamics and model-based control
	- different robot control strategy
		- Altas: MPC + optimization
		- Quadruped robotï¼š RL
		- manipulation: imitation
	- what makes control difficult
		- Uncertainty/partial observation: observation
		- Actions have long-term consequence: controllability
		- nonlinear, high dimension
	- system representation
		- $\ddot{q}=f_{1}(q,\dot{q})+f_{2}(q,\dot{q})u$
			- "control affine" nonlinear system
		- Def (1) is fully actuated in $q,\dot{q}$ iff $f_{2}(q,\dot{q})$ is full row rank
		- Def (1) is underactuated is iff above is wrong
	- if actuated
		- we can do the $\ddot{q}$ =u like equivalence
		- but it will break if model uncertainty
		- control limits
		- state constraints
	- Manipulator eqs
		- $M(q)\ddot{q}+C(q,\dot{q})q=\Gamma(q)+Bu$
		- kinematic energy T=$\frac{1}{2}\dot{q}^TM(q)\dot{q}$
		- if B is full row rank it's actuated
