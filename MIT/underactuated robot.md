- Lecture1 : Robot dynamics and model-based control
	- different robot control strategy
		- Altas: MPC + optimization
		- Quadruped robotï¼š RL
		- manipulation: imitation
	- what makes control difficult
		- Uncertainty/partial observation: observation
		- Actions have long-term consequence: controllability
		- nonlinear, high dimension
	- system representation
		- $\ddot{q}=f_{1}(q,\dot{q})+f_{2}(q,\dot{q})u$
			- "control affine" nonlinear system
		- Def (1) is fully actuated in $q,\dot{q}$ iff $f_{2}(q,\dot{q})$ is full row rank
		- Def (1) is underactuated is iff above is wrong
	- if actuated
		- we can do the $\ddot{q}$ =u like equivalence
		- but it will break if model uncertainty
		- control limits
		- state constraints
	- Manipulator eqs
		- $M(q)\ddot{q}+C(q,\dot{q})q=\Gamma(q)+Bu$
		- kinematic energy T=$\frac{1}{2}\dot{q}^TM(q)\dot{q}$
		- if B is full row rank it's actuated  
## Lecture2: Nonlinear Dynamics
- Simple Pendulum dynamics
	- Using Lagrangian
		- T=$\frac{1}{2}ml^{2}\dot{\theta}^{2}$
		- $V=-mgl\cos\theta$
		- L = T-V
		- do the dLdtdqdot-pLpq=Q
		- then we get the one
- Stable
	- asymptotical stable
	- region attractive
	- exponential stable
	- in sense of L
- Recurrent neuron network
	- we have a graphical theorem to check the fixed point
	- it can memory some point and forget some point
- doing vector field analysis
	- we can see that pendulum work
	- if actuated it can fully control all the point
