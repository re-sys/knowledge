	- Newtonian Mechanics Review
		- Describing motion of particle or point mass
		- particle -> configuration is completely by position
		- In coordinate-free form
			- F=$\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt},\vec{p}=m\vec{v}$
			- if m is constant then F=ma
		- Note that we we can't actually do anything until we choose coordinates.
		- basis stuff and component stuff
		- pole coordinate
			- $\begin{bmatrix}Fr \\ F\theta \end{bmatrix}=m\begin{bmatrix}\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^{2} \\ r \ddot{\theta }+2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}\end{bmatrix}$
			- it comes from e=cosex+sin ey
			- $\theta=-\sin e_{x}+\cos(\theta)e_{y}$
		- Becomes super impractical for complex
			- Example: Pendulum
				- $\ddot{\theta}=-\frac{l}{g}\sin(\theta)$
			- constraint was non-trivial in Cartesian coordinates but simple in polar coordinates
			- We could ignore the r-direction dynamics and only care about theta
			- we also never had to explicitly calculate T (cable tension/constraint force)
			- This system has 1 DOF If we can use just 1 coordinate we call that minimal or joint coordinate
			- most current robotics simulators use minimal/joint coordinates.
			- most current robotics simulates use minimal not always best option
			- The opposite approach (full Cartesian coordinate explicit cartesian)
